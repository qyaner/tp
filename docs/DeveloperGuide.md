### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component
The UI component handles the user-interface portion of the application.

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component
The Logic component handles the execution of commands.

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePatientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command. 
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePatientCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`. 
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person). 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete-patient 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-patient 1` Command](images/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePatientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeletePatientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ToothTrackerModelClassDiagram.png" width="700"/>

The `Model` component,

* stores the ToothTracker address book data i.e., all `Patient`, `Dentist`, `Appointment`, and `Treatment` objects
(which are contained in a `UniquePatientList`, `UniqueDentistList`, `UniqueAppointmentList`, and `UniqueTreatmentList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient`, `Dentist`, or `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a `search-patient`, `search-dentist`, or `filter-appointment`)
  as corresponding separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>`, `ObservableList<Dentist>` and `Observable<Appointment>`
  that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/ToothTrackerStorage.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

The features implemented are categorized into 4 sections:

1. [Dentist Features](#dentist-features)
2. [Patient Features](#patient-features)
3. [Appointment Features](#appointment-features)
4. [Treatment Features](#treatment-features)
5. [General Features](#general-features)

### Dentist Features

#### Adding a Dentist

The `add-dentist` command creates a new dentist record in ToothTracker. This command forms the fundamental business logic to represent dentists.

The activity diagram for creating a new dentist is illustrated as follows:

![AddDentistActivityDiagram](images/AddDentistActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `add-dentist` command:

![AddDentistSequenceDiagram](images/AddDentistSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. Users provide essential dentist information, such as their name, phone number, specialization, years of experience and other optional details like email, address and tags.
2. In case of missing or invalid command arguments, the system prompts users with an error message to enter the command correctly.
3. The system cross-references the new dentist's name with existing records in the `Model` to prevent duplicate entries. If a duplicate is found, an error message informs the user.
4. If step 3 is completed without any exceptions, the new patient record is created and stored in the system.

##### Feature Considerations

For dentist specialization, broader terms like "orthodontics" are used instead of specifying the exact type of treatment (e.g., root canal, braces, scaling).
This approach prevents the "add-dentist" command from becoming excessively long.

The working hours of a dentist is not an attribute in the `add-dentist` command as dentists might not immediately know their
shifts when they first join, and it might change frequently.

We handle duplicates by not allowing multiple dentists of the same name to be created (eg. only 1 John Tan can exist in ToothTracker). We will allow multiple dentists of 
the same name to be created in future implementations. For now, if there are multiple dentists with the same name, add in additional information such as their last 3 digits of NRIC
as part of their name attribute.

#### Deleting a Dentist

The `delete-dentist` command deletes a dentist record in ToothTracker. This command forms the fundamental business logic to represent dentists.

The activity diagram for deleting a dentist is illustrated as follows:

![DeleteDentistActivityDiagram](images/DeleteDentistActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `delete-dentist` command:

![DeleteDentistSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteDentistSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies a dentist id that represents a `Dentist` to be edited.
2. If an invalid `DENTIST_ID` is provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The Dentist is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it exists. If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. If step 3 completes without any exceptions, then the `Dentist` is successfully deleted.

##### Feature Considerations

In implementing the delete feature, we needed proper error handling and validation to ensure ToothTracker's robustness and provide clear guidance to the user.
Our approach validates dentist ID and shows an error message if the dentist does not exist.
This is in comparison to allowing commands to fail silently if the dentist specified does not exist.

- Pros: Prevents invalid operations and provides immediate feedback to the user, helping to correct mistakes.
- Cons: Additional validation checks add complexity to the code.


#### Searching for a dentist

The `search-dentist` command finds dentist records in ToothTracker by allowing users to enter a specific `DENTIST_ID` or
name-related keywords.

The activity diagram for searching for a dentist is illustrated as follows:

![SearchDentistActivityDiagram](images/SearchDentistActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `search-dentist` command:

![SearchDentistSequenceDiagram](images/SearchDentistSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. Users initiate a search for a dentist using either a unique `DENTIST_ID` or by inputting specific `KEYWORDS` that might match a dentist's name.
2. If the user opts for an ID-based search, the system processes the request to return a single record that matches the provided `DENTIST_ID`.
3. If keywords are used, the system performs a broader search by comparing the keywords as substrings with the names in the dentist records.
4. In scenarios where the search criteria do not correspond with any existing records (either no matching ID or keywords), the system generates an error message informing the user of the unsuccessful search attempt.
5. When matches are found, the system displays a list of dentists whose records meet the search criteria.

##### Feature Considerations

The `search-dentist` feature in ToothTracker focuses on searching using either a unique `DENTIST_ID` or keywords matching a dentist's name,
prioritizing speed and simplicity in accessing dentist records. For more complex searching which requires additional dentist attributes, users
are recommended to use the `filter-dentist` command instead. This approach ensures a balanced functionality within ToothTracker, offering a balance
between quick searches for immediate needs while also accommodating more complex and attribute-specific inquiries.

#### Filtering a dentist

The `filter-dentist` command in ToothTracker provides users with a more refined search functionality, allowing them to filter dentist records based on
specific criteria beyond just `DENTIST_ID` or name-related keywords. This feature offers a versatile and detailed search capability for users who
require precise results from the dentist records database.

The activity diagram for filtering dentists is illustrated as follows:

![FilterDentistActivityDiagram](images/FilterDentistActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `filter-dentist` command:

![FilterDentistSequenceDiagram](images/FilterDentistSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. Users initiate a filter for a dentist by providing various filter criteria such as SPECIALIZATION, EXPERIENCE, TAGS, and more.
These criteria allow users to search for dentists with specific attributes.
2. ToothTracker processes the user's filter criteria and matches them against the dentist records in the database.
3. Dentists that meet the filter criteria are displayed as search results, providing users with a list of dentists that fulfill their specific requirements.
4. If no matches are found for the given filter criteria, the system informs the user that no results were found based on the specified filters.

##### Feature Considerations

The `filter-dentist` feature in ToothTracker is tailored for users who require precise control over their dentist searches. Unlike the `search-dentist` command,
which primarily relies on `DENTIST_ID` and name-related keywords, the `filter-dentist` command operates by filtering based on specific attributes within a dentist's record.

To ensure the validity of the filter criteria, the  filter-dentist command conducts validation checks to confirm that the selected attribute for filtering is a valid attribute
associated with a dentist's record.

It is important to note that the filter-dentist feature does not perform validation checks within each attribute to verify whether the entered
keyword is of a valid type for that particular attribute. Users are responsible for inputting keywords that are meaningful and applicable to the chosen attribute.


### Patient Features


#### Adding a Patient

The `add-patient` command creates a new patient record in ToothTracker.          

The activity diagram for creating a new patient is illustrated as follows:

![AddPatientActivityDiagram](images/AddPatientActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram of the `add-patient` command:

![AddPatientSequenceDiagram](images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. Users provide essential patient information, such as their name, phone number, gender, birthday and optional details such as remark, treatment, email, address and tags.
2. In case of missing or invalid command arguments, the system prompts users with an error message to enter the command correctly.
3. The system cross-references the new patients name with existing records in the `Model` to prevent duplicate entries. If a duplicate is found, an error message informs the user.
4. If step 3 is completed without any exceptions, the new patient record is created and stored in the system.

##### Feature Considerations
For the optional `Treatment` field, should the user opt to enter a treatment, it is mandatory that the specified treatment already exists within ToothTracker.
If this condition is not met, the user will receive an error message.

#### Deleting a Patient

The `delete-patient` command deletes a patient record in ToothTracker. 

The activity diagram for deleting a patient is illustrated as follows:

![DeletePatientActivityDiagram](images/DeletePatientActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `delete-patient` command:

![DeletePatientSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies a patient id that represents a `Patient` to be deleted.
2. If an invalid `PATIENT_ID` is provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The Patient is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it exists. If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. If step 3 completes without any exceptions, then the `Patient` is successfully deleted.

##### Feature Considerations

In implementing the delete feature, we needed proper error handling and validation to ensure ToothTracker's robustness and provide clear guidance to the user.
Our approach validates patient ID and shows an error message if the patient does not exist.
This is in comparison to allowing commands to fail silently if patient does not exist.

- Pros: Prevents invalid operations and provides immediate feedback to the user, helping to correct mistakes.
- Cons: Additional validation checks add complexity to the code.


#### Searching for a patient

The `search-patient` command finds patient records in ToothTracker by allowing users to enter a specific `PATIENT_ID` or
name-related keywords.

The activity diagram for searching for a patient is illustrated as follows:

![SearchPatientActivityDiagram](images/SearchPatientActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `search-patient` command:

![SearchPatientSequenceDiagram](images/SearchPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. Users initiate a search for a patient using either a unique `PATIENT_ID` or by inputting specific `KEYWORDS` that might match a patient's name.
2. If the user opts for an ID-based search, the system processes the request to return a single record that matches the provided `PATIENT_ID`.
3. If keywords are used, the system performs a broader search by comparing the keywords as substrings with the names in the patient records.
4. In scenarios where the search criteria do not correspond with any existing records (either no matching ID or keywords), the system generates an error message informing the user of the unsuccessful search attempt.
5. When matches are found, the system displays a list of patients whose records meet the search criteria.

##### Feature Considerations

The `search-patient` feature in ToothTracker focuses on searching using either a unique `PATIENT_ID` or keywords matching a patient's name,
prioritizing speed and simplicity in accessing patient records. For more complex searching which requires additional patient attributes, users
are recommended to use the `filter-patient` command instead. This approach ensures a balanced functionality within ToothTracker, offering a balance
between quick searches for immediate needs while also accommodating more complex and attribute-specific inquiries.

#### Filtering a patient

The `filter-patient` command in ToothTracker provides users with a more refined search functionality, allowing them to filter patient records based on
specific criteria beyond just `PATIENT_ID` or name-related keywords. This feature offers a versatile and detailed search capability for users who
require precise results from the patient records database.

The activity diagram for filtering patient is illustrated as follows:

![FilterPatientActivityDiagram](images/FilterPatientActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `filter-patient` command:

![FilterPatientSequenceDiagram](images/FilterPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. Users initiate a filter for a patient by providing various filter criteria such as Remarks, Treatment and more.
   These criteria allow users to search for patients with specific attributes.
2. ToothTracker processes the user's filter criteria and matches them against the patient records in the database.
3. Patients that meet the filter criteria are displayed as search results, providing users with a list of patients that fulfill their specific requirements.
4. If no matches are found for the given filter criteria, the system informs the user that no results were found based on the specified filters.

##### Feature Considerations

The `filter-patient` feature in ToothTracker is tailored for users who require precise control over their patient searches. Unlike the `search-patient` command,
which primarily relies on `PATIENT_ID` and name-related keywords, the `filter-patient` command operates by filtering based on specific attributes within a patient's record.

To ensure the validity of the filter criteria, the  filter-patient command conducts validation checks to confirm that the selected attribute for filtering is a valid attribute
associated with a patient's record.

It is important to note that the filter-patient feature does not perform validation checks within each attribute to verify whether the entered
keyword is of a valid type for that particular attribute. Users are responsible for inputting keywords that are meaningful and applicable to the chosen attribute.

### Appointment Features

#### Adding an Appointment

The `add-appointment` command creates a new appointment record in ToothTracker.

The activity diagram for creating a new appointment is illustrated as follows:

![AddAppointmentActivityDiagram](images/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `add-appointment` command:

![AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. Users provide essential appointment information, such as the dentist ID, patient ID, appointment start time and treatment name.
2. In case of missing or invalid command arguments, the system prompts users with an error message to enter the command correctly.
3. The system retrieves information about the treatment cost, duration, dentist and patient from the `Model` using the information provided by the user.
4. The system checks the new appointment's time slot with existing appointments in the `Model` to prevent clashing appointments.
If a timing clash is found, an error message informs the user.
5. If step 4 is completed without any exceptions, the new appointment record is created and stored in the system.

##### Feature Considerations

For the dentist ID, patient ID and treatment field, it is mandatory that the specified dentist, patient and treatment exists in ToothTracker.
If these conditions are not met, the user will receive an error message.

After adding an appointment, the details of the appointment can no longer be changed even if the details of the dentist,
patient or treatment are changed as we did not implement cascading. 

#### Deleting an Appointment

The `delete-appointment` command deletes an appointment record from ToothTracker.

The activity diagram for deleting an appointment is illustrated as follows:

![DeleteAppointmentActivityDiagram](images/DeleteAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `delete-appointment` command:

![DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies an appointment id that represents an `Appointment` to be deleted.
2. If an invalid `APPOINTMENT_ID` is provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The Appointment is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it exists. If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. If step 3 completes without any exceptions, then the `Appointment` is successfully deleted.

##### Feature Considerations

In implementing the delete feature, we needed proper error handling and validation to ensure ToothTracker's robustness and provide clear guidance to the user.
Our approach validates appointment ID and shows an error message if the appointment does not exist.
This is in comparison to allowing commands to fail silently if appointment does not exist.

- Pros: Prevents invalid operations and provides immediate feedback to the user, helping to correct mistakes.
- Cons: Additional validation checks add complexity to the code.


#### Filtering an Appointment

The `filter-appointment` command filters appointments by DENTIST_ID or PATIENT_ID.

The activity diagram for filtering an appointment is illustrated as follows:

![FilterAppointmentActivityDiagram](images/FilterAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `filter-appointment` command:

![DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/FilterAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. Users initiate a filter for appointments using either a unique `DENTIST_ID` or a unique `PATIENT_ID`.
2. If an invalid `DENTIST_ID` or `PATIENT_ID` is provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message. 
3. If the user opts to filter by `DENTIST_ID`, the system processes the request to return a list of appointments with the specific dentist. 
4. If the user opts to filter by `PATIENT_ID`, the system processes the request to return a list of appointments with the specific patient. 
5. If there are no appointments with the specific dentist or patient, the system informs the user that no appointments were found with the specific dentist or patient.

##### Feature Considerations

Validity checks are performed to ensure that the `DENTIST_ID` or `PATIENT_ID` are valid and that they type of ID to filter by is clearly stated.
Otherwise, user would receive an error message that guides them to input the right command and details.

If no appointments with the specific dentist or patient are found in ToothTracker, it should be clearly
communicated to the user instead of just displaying an empty list. A message stating that no appointments with the
specified `DENTIST_ID` or `PATIENT_ID` are found would be displayed to the user.

### Treatment Features

#### Adding a Treatment

The `add-treatment` command creates a new treatment record in ToothTracker.

The activity diagram for creating a new treatment is illustrated as follows:

![AddTreatmentActivityDiagram](images/AddTreatmentActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram of the `add-treatment` command:

![AddTreatmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddTreatmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. Users would key in the available treatments in their clinic, specifying the treatment name, cost and its duration.
2. In case of missing or invalid command arguments, the system prompts users with an error message to enter the command correctly.
3. The system cross-references the new treatment name with existing records in the `Model` to prevent duplicate entries. If a duplicate is found, an error message informs the user.
4. If step 3 is completed without any exceptions, the new treatment record is created and stored in the system.


#### Listing a Treatment

The `list-treatment` command would list all treatments recorded in ToothTracker.

##### Feature Details
1. Users would key in the `list-treatment`
2. All available treatments would be listed in the command box.
3. In the event that there are no treatments, ToothTracker would display a message in the command box.

##### Feature Considerations
- Due to the space constraints of ToothTracker, only treatment names would be displayed to the user. 
Ideally, cost and duration of each treatment should be shown to the user. However, this would clutter
up the command box pretty quickly.
- Ideally, another window would be created, which would display all available treatments and  their 
associated costs and durations.


#### Deleting a Treatment

The `delete-treatment` command deletes a treatment record in ToothTracker.

The activity diagram for deleting a treatment is illustrated as follows:

![DeleteTreatmentActivityDiagram](images/DeleteTreatmentActivityDiagram.png)

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the various components during the execution of the `delete-treatment` command:
