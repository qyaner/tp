### Project: ToothTracker

**Overview**

ToothTracker is an all-in-one solution designed to revolutionize
the management of dental clinic records.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add appointment ([#64](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/64),
 [#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/86), [#88](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/88),
[#103](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/103))
  * What it does: Allows user to add in an appointment to ToothTracker.
  * Justification: This feature is an essential feature of ToothTracker as it allows user to keep track
  of their clinic's past and future appointments. It helps to simplify the process of recording down an
  appointment.
  * Highlights: The command is heavily intertwined with other commands as it needs to retrieve
  critical information from the model. If other add commands do not work, `add-appointment` would not work either.
  It was difficult trying to retrieve the correct information and also checking for appointment clashes.

* **New Feature**: Delete appointment ([#103](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/103))
  * What it does: Deletes an appointment from ToothTracker permanently. This is done using a unique appointment id.
  * Justification: This is a crucial feature as it allows user to delete incorrect or irrelevant appointment details.

* **New Feature**: List appointment ([#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/86), [#88](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/88))
  * What it does: Allows user to list all appointments and their details saved in ToothTracker
  * Justification: This is important as user needs to be able to view all appointments details to keep track of the clinic's records.

* **New Feature**: Filter appointment ([#103](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/103), [#111](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/111))
  * What it does: Filters appointment by dentist id or patient id.
  * Justification: This command provides user with a more convenient way to view appointments. Instead of
  scrolling down a long list of appointments, user can just filter to view the appointment with the specific
  dentist or patient easily.
